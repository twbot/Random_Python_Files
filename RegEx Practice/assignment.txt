Write a class to represent a person based on the information in the text file. They should have names, email addresses, phone numbers, jobs, and Twitter accounts. Remember, some of these can be blank, though!

To go ever further, make a class to act as as address book to hold all of the people class instances created above. Can you make it searchable?
